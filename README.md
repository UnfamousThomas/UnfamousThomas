### Hi there, I'm Thomas 👋

# About Me
I'm a software engineer based in Tallinn, Estonia 🇪🇪  
Bachelor’s in Computer Science (University of Tartu, 2025).

Currently completing conscription (until June 2026) in the **Cyber Division**, where I work on real-world software systems.

I enjoy building a wide range of projects, from web applications to complex Kubernetes operators for managing game servers. In my free time, I maintain a small Minecraft server project.
